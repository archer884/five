# five

You guessed it: you can run this program to find out whether or not it's really "5 o'clock somewhere."

...I got the timezone offsets from a list of timezone offsets on Wikipedia, which means that I'm including all the alternative "daylight saving" timezones that I probably shouldn't have in here, but I'm cool with that. In the end, don't you *want* it to be 5 o'clock somewhere?
